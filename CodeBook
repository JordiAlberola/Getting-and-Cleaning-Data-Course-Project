The script run_analysis.R performs the 5 steps described in the course project's assignment.

Data is downloaded and unzipped in folder "./data". Then read to the following data frames:
•	“Activity_Train_data”
•	“Activity_Test_data”
•	“Subject_Train_data”
•	“Subject_Test_data”
•	“Features_Train_data”
•	“Features_Test_data”

Train and test data for Activity, Subject and Features data are concatenated (merged vertically) and their variables named in the following data frames:
•	“Activity_ data”
•	“Subject_data”
•	“Features_data”

“Subject_data”, “Activity_data” and “Features_data” data frames are joined (merged horizontally) in data frame “Data”.

The measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement are extracted to the data frame “Mean_STD_data”.

Descriptive activity names from file "activity_labels.txt" are read to data frame “activityLabels”.
 
Data frame “Data” is updated with activity names from data frame “activityLabels”.

Variables in data frame “Data” are labeled with the following more descriptive names: 
•	"Acc" labeled “Accelerometer"
•	"Gyro" labeled “Gyroscope"
•	"BodyBody" labeled “Body"
•	"Mag" labeled “Magnitude"
•	"^t" labeled “Time"
•	"^f" labeled “Frequency"
•	"tBody" labeled “TimeBody"
•	"-mean()" labeled  "Mean"
•	"-std()" labeled  "STD"
•	"-freq()" labeled  "Frequency"
•	"angle" labeled “Angle"
•	"gravity" labeled “Gravity"

Finally, an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject is created in data frame “Data_2nd".
