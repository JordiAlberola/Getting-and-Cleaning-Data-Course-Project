# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repository contains the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data". More information can be found at the courseâ€™s site.

All the data are in the same folder and decompressed without further changes.
The CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and transformations or cleaning and tidying work performed on the data.
The run_analysis.R script contains the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps.
The output of the 5th step is called "tidydata.txt", and is also uploaded.
